# Project 2: (Don't Scare) The Reaper
> By Alex Woo & Jacob Janowski

## Introduction
The project revolves around the idea of having users cope with their fears and how the significance of a virtual world can help them overcome their phobias. The user will have the freedom to walk around the area of the building and the capability pick up certain items with their hands. The user will be able to activate items in order to produce newer ones or to allow for animations to be created for the user experience. This would involve using a vending machine to get a drink or an elevator button to go to the next floor. All of which are designed to help the user use these actions and tools to help them get rid of any fears that haunt them.
